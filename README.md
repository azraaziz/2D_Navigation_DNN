# 2D_Navigation_DNN
2D_upload.py is the main file for basic model of grid cells and place cells (Neurons found in parts of brain that help us to navigate).
This model is based on autoencoder stack, where the compressed respresntation of movement of animal gives the desired results.
Further the model is made more versatile, by including visual inputs along with locomotion for navigation. For getting the visual inputs, Unity software is 
used to create 2D environments and the agent is made to run. The egocentric view w.r.t the agent is captured and fed into the network. 
The codes for the same can be found in DistoCode and Multicompartment folder.
